## [1.0.0-beta.1+1] - February 16 2019

We are finally in BETA. This means we're one step closer to our first stable release.

Thanks to all the contributes.

Support GraphQL Upload spec as proposed at
https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec

### What's changed?

We have added a brand new `Link` that handles authentication. You can drop it in like so:

```dart
final HttpLink httpLink = HttpLink(
  uri: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
);

final AuthLink authLink = AuthLink(
  getToken: () async => 'Bearer $YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN',
);

final Link link = authLink.concat(httpLink);

GraphQLClient client = GraphQLClient(
  cache: NormalizedInMemoryCache(
    dataIdFromObject: typenameDataIdFromObject,
  ),
  link: link,
);
```

The `getToken` function will be called right before each event gets passed to the next link. It set the `Authorization` header to the value returned by `getToken` and passes it under the `header` map to the context.
